# Deepika Webserver Test
# Requirements 

```
1- Create End-2-End connectivity for every service to automate! 	
2- Build automation for NaaS  with DevOps tooling (CDaaS tooling)
3- SIT & UAT testing of all NaaS services
4- Build testautomation and automate all testcases for NaaS
5- Support squads in building & maintaining environments
6- Drive innovation inside NaaS on the infrastructure level
```

```
1- Build a dockerized web server that displays a simple webpage. Document the steps and configurations.
2- A webpage that shows: “Hello DevOps NaaS <Name of yourself> + date of that day”
3- Container can be pulled from docker hub with: “docker pull <Candidate-Webserver-Test>”
4- Container has to run on an on your own docker installation
```
```
Web Server and Webpage:
Write a simple web application or use an existing one that displays a basic webpage. The content contains a "Hello, DevOps!" message.
Choose a web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to serve the webpage.
Docker Containerization:
Create a Dockerfile to containerize the web server and the webpage.
Ensure that the Dockerfile is efficient and follows best practices.
Container Registry:
Publish the Docker image to a container registry of your choice (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).
CI/CD Pipeline:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
Configure the pipeline to trigger on each commit to the main branch.
Include stages for building the Docker image and pushing it to the container registry.
```

```
